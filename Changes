Revision history for Perl extension EV and the embedded libev library

3.41 Thu May 22 01:39:40 CEST 2008
	- (libev) fix many heap-related bugs (timers, periodics).
        - (libev) improve timing stability of timers and periodics.
        - clarify documentation for periodic reschedule callbacks.
        - verify that the passed callback argument is indeed a code
          reference, for earlier error reporting and a nice calling
          speed increase (as well as saving memory).

3.4  Tue May 20 21:51:55 CEST 2008
        - (libev) work around both a windows bug and a bug in perl's
          select on windows when not waiting for any file descriptors.
	- bundle ev.pod into the tarball, just to increase its size
          (and for the poor internetless person).
          
3.33 Sun May 18 12:43:04 CEST 2008
	- (libev) use numerous enhancements such as a more
          cache-friendly 4-heap and heap index caching for timers.

3.2  Wed Apr  2 17:08:16 CEST 2008
	- "ported" again to the Microsoft "C" language.
        - relax testsuite timing for the benefit of freebsd users once more.
        - fix EVAPI's ev_time and ev_sleep macros.
        - (libev) fix select backend on 64 bit architetcures.
        - (libev) ev_loop flags are now local to each invocation.

3.1  Sat Mar  8 11:41:14 CET 2008
	- add ev_sync_* and ev_fork_* to EVAPI.h.
	- provide EV::Embed->sweep method.

	- upgrade to libev-3.0.
        - change child handler to incorporate tracing flag.

2.01 Mon Dec 31 01:59:19 CET 2007
	- found a minor problem in the testsuite that is only
          caught by new Test::Harness versions (reported by Andreas
          KÃ¶nig).

2.0  Sat Dec 22 17:47:03 CET 2007
	- no longer force kqueue when enabled, enable it
          on more systems (as its now by default not used on most).
	- expose fork watchers.
        - switch to libev's MULTIPLICITY API.
        - use a slightly different include file name strategy.
        - get rid of (unused) libevent emulation.
        - 5% watcher management speedup due to callback optimisation
          when inline closures are used, 5% slowdown due to multiplicity.
        - very minimal support for dynamic event loops and embed watchers.
        - fix name of prepare start/stop methods.
        - create and export EV::sleep and EV::set_*_collect_interval.

        - add periodic->at methods.

1.85 Fri Dec 14 20:32:40 CET 2007
        - further optimise epoll backend by adding a heuristic that
          avoids EPOLL_CTL_DEL calls if possible.
	- EV::signal->start was not async-signal safe.
        - optimise start/stop when the fd hasn't changed.

1.8  Tue Dec 11 22:17:46 CET 2007
	- API version 3:0.
	- reduced fudge factor to zero for select, poll, epoll
          and kqueue: your system better be posix-compliant
          even in its extensions :->
        - improve long-term numerical stability in periodic watchers
          by introducing a separate offset value instead of reusing at.
        - recalculate real/monotonic clocks before blocking fully
          to avoid blocking for longer than necessary.
        - fix bugs in the heap functions. this rarely lead to illegal
          heap orderings.

1.72 Sat Dec  8 15:31:26 CET 2007
	- add dummy loop arguments to some EVAPI functions
          so that clients can use EV_A and EV_DEFAULT.

        - minor bugfixes and portability fixes.

1.2  Thu Nov 22 05:44:09 CET 2007
        - disable kqueue by default on !netbsd, as its broken on freebsd,
          darwin and openbsd and thus almost everywhere.
