Revision history for Perl extension EV

1.4  Tue Nov 27 17:35:27 CET 2007
	- work around a linux 2.4 kernel bug in child handlers.
        - implement stat watcher interface.
        - implement fork watcher interface.
        - io->set did not keep the fh alive.
        - actively check signal numbers/names to be valid.
        - cleanups, minor fixes, new bugs.
        - work around windows bugs in the testsuite.

1.3  Sun Nov 25 10:46:57 CET 2007
	- stopping idle/check/prepare watchers could cause data corruption.
	- implement and document EV::once.
        - improved documentation, verify that netbsd indeed has the only
          working kqueue implementation (out of darwin, freebsd, netbsd and
          openbsd). Praise them!
        - fix the data method so it might work.
        - expose ev_ref/ev_unref to the C API.
        - expose ref/unref in form of the ->keepalive method to perl.
        - minor bugfixes and portability fixes.

1.2  Thu Nov 22 05:44:09 CET 2007
        - disable kqueue by default on !netbsd, as its broken on freebsd,
          darwin and openbsd and thus almost everywhere.
        - add some allowance in t/01_timer.t for the uneven monotonic
          vs. realtime clock tick on at least freebsd.
        - add -lsocket -lnsl on solaris in case the perl guy forgot to
          configure them.

1.1  Wed Nov 21 06:08:48 CET 2007
	- improved timer test to include periodics and
          withstand small timing variations.
        - many minor tweaks to libev.

1.0  Fri Nov 16 14:51:59 CET 2007
	- require AnyEvent update if AnyEvent is installed.
	- add solaris 10 port-based backend.
        - add child_ns and fix check_ns.
        - treat yes/no as enforcement, not as hint, when configuring,
          documentation update (reported by Andy Grundman).

0.9  Wed Nov 14 22:24:49 CET 2007
	- changed LIBEV_METHODS to LIBEV_FLAGS and the
          way this is used inside libev.
        - many, many bugfixes.
        - add unloop constants.
        - add timer test.
        - ev_loop will now terminate immediately when no watchers are active.

0.8  Mon Nov 12 02:28:46 CET 2007
	- fix "testsuite" again :().
        - fix check/idle/prepare/child watcher stop.

        - rewritten select backend (mostly for win32).
        - cache socket handles on win32.
        - provide considerably finer control over configuration.

0.7  Fri Nov  9 20:37:58 CET 2007
	- move AnyEvent adaptor into the AnyEvent module.
        - use private copy of evdns.[ch].
        - many minor fixes.

0.6  Thu Nov  8 18:23:43 CET 2007
	- better native win32 support (not relevant for perl usually).
        - fix idle watchers.
        - implement and document periodic reschedule callbacks.
        - do not run dns test on !linux platforms (actually to exclude win32).
        - fix (unused in EV :) poll backend.

0.51 Tue Nov  6 19:50:22 CET 2007
	- fix kqueue/poll compilation issue.
        - work around design issues in kqueue.
        - enable kqueue by default, seems to work.

0.5  Tue Nov  6 17:37:44 CET 2007
	- add signal and pid mutators.
        - add rstatus/rpid accessors.
        - updated libev (lower cost for clock monotonic).
        - support event priorities.
        - try to find SIG_SIZE on perls that don't have it (Slaven Rezic).
        - improved signal handling, fixed child watchers.
        - experimentally add kqueue backend, completely untested.
        - ported to cygwin and native win32.
